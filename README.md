I created this account a few months ago for my Coding Club. I have not created a repository until now which highlights my portfolio projects.
My repository illustrates the files for my portfolio website. I made these files to highlight my journey through IT so far. It includes an about me, contact, projects, and home page. 
To clone the repository I clicked the button when I first opened the app. It then gave me a folder directory so I could locate the folder for later use. This is when I added my website files by copying and pasting them from the original folder. I committed the changes and I pressed "publish" (substitute for push origin)
