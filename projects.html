      <br>Flappy Bird<br>
        The Flappy Bird project is classic for an intro to coding. I learned this tutorial from Code.org and Scratch. In the program, I create the functions of the entire game through block coding. This includes motion, text, and conditional statements.<br><br>

		Resume<br>I created a resume from coding app Mimo to show my work experience over time. I only have done one job position, so it was simple. I implemented the code to show the months and years I've been at my job. Mimo provided the profile image, but I manually entered the code.a<br><br>

This was an extensive progress, considering the kit is outdated and is not a recent product. Although, we were able to finish creating one and ran test programs.<br><br></p>
